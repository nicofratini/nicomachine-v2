# Architecture Design Patterns

## Microservices Architecture
- Design services around business capabilities
- Implement proper service boundaries with domain-driven design
- Use API gateways for service orchestration
- Implement distributed tracing and monitoring

## Database Design
- Choose appropriate database types for each service (SQL/NoSQL)
- Implement proper data modeling with normalization
- Design for scalability with sharding and replication strategies
- Ensure data consistency with ACID properties or eventual consistency

## Integration Patterns
- Use event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Implement proper API versioning strategies
- Design fault-tolerant systems with circuit breakers
- Plan for graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

## Security Architecture
- Implement zero-trust security model
- Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for authentication
- Design proper authorization with RBAC or ABAC
- Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
