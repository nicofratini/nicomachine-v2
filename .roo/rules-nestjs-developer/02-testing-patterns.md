# Backend Testing Patterns

## Unit Testing
- Test services in isolation with proper mocking
- Use dependency injection for testable code
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain high test coverage for business logic

## Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with real database connections
- Use test databases for integration tests
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Validate request/response schemas

## Performance Testing
- Test API response times under load
- Validate database query performance
- Test connection pool behavior
- Monitor memory usage and garbage collection
