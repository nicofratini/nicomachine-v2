# Performance Requirements

## Frontend Performance
- Core Web Vitals scores: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Bundle size optimization with tree-shaking and code splitting
- Image optimization with WebP format and lazy loading
- Implement proper caching strategies for static assets

## Tailwind CSS Performance
- Use JIT mode for faster build times and smaller CSS bundles
- Configure proper purging to remove unused CSS classes
- Optimize Tailwind config to include only needed utilities
- Use CSS-in-JS patterns sparingly to avoid runtime overhead
- Bundle size target: < 50KB for purged Tailwind CSS

## CSS Optimization
- Minimize custom CSS by leveraging Tailwind utilities
- Use critical CSS loading for above-the-fold content
- Implement proper CSS caching with long-term cache headers
- Avoid @apply directive overuse to prevent bundle bloat

## Runtime Performance
- Minimize DOM manipulations and prefer declarative rendering
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities instead of JavaScript media queries
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and components
- Optimize animations using CSS transforms and Tailwind utilities

## Backend Performance
- API response times < 200ms for simple queries
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Use caching layers (Redis) for frequently accessed data

## Voice Interface Performance
- Initial voice response < 500ms
- Audio processing latency < 100ms for real-time interactions
- Network adaptive bitrate for varying connection quality
- Graceful degradation for poor network conditions

## Build Performance
- Development build time < 5 seconds with Tailwind JIT
- Production build optimization with proper minification
- Tree-shaking enabled for all dependencies
- Code splitting for optimal chunk sizes
